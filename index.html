            <p class="blog-2">Eren's appearance changes quite drastically when<br> he transformed into the Attack
                Titan.His
                height increased<br> to 15 m, his hair grew long enough to graze his shoulders,<br> and his tongue and
                ears
                became elongated. His facial features<br> also underwent a transformation; he developed a prominent,<br>
                hooked
                nose, his eyes became deeply sunken within their sockets,<br> and his mouth took on an unusual, jagged
                shape
                that was<br>unsuited for intelligible speech. Despite this, he was capable<br>of howling and roaring in
                order
                to express his exhaustion and anger.<br> In addition, he also lacked lips and flesh on his cheeks, so
                his
                teeth were exposed.
